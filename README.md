# GB Studio Plugin Collection
A collection of GB Studio 3.0 plugins made by Yousurname. Not to be confused with [Pautomas's Plugin Pak](https://github.com/pau-tomas/gb-studio-plugins).

## Transfer SGB Packet Plugin
Transfers SGB packets for accessing SGB features. It currently only supports applying a palette to a rectangular area. [Old Repository](https://github.com/Y0UR-U5ERNAME/GB-Studio-Transfer-SGB-Packet-Plugin)

## Dialogue With Name Tag/Large Avatar Plugin
Allows a dialogue to have a name tag and/or a large avatar made of text. Note: All fonts that you use for the name tag or large avatar will have to be used in a different dialogue.

## Actor Set Collision Box Plugin
Sets the collision box of an actor without having to change spritesheets.

## Change Scene With No Fade (Glitchy) Plugin
Changes the scene without fading, causing glitchy effects usually. Note that this will not load the Background and Sprite Palettes from the selected scene automatically, and the background will appear all black on DMG.

## While Loop Plugin
Runs the following code as long as the condition is true. There is a built-in event for this in 3.1, but this will stay here for archival purposes.

## Set Palette Colors Plugin (not updated for 3.1 yet)
Sets each of the individual colors of either the DMG or GBC palettes. The current version only works with v3.0.3. Use previous versions without setting GBC palettes to variables for greater compatibility.
